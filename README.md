# 🩺 Retrieval-Augmented Medical Question Answering Assistant

An AI-powered medical question-answering web application that uses **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** to retrieve relevant medical information from trusted sources before generating a response.

## 📌 Overview

The system allows users to ask medical questions through a simple web interface. It retrieves relevant information from the **MedQuAD dataset** using semantic search and provides the retrieved context to a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate a clear and context-aware response.

The system is designed to reduce unsupported AI responses and provide source references along with generated answers.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Develop a user-friendly medical question-answering assistant.
- Integrate the MedQuAD dataset as the medical knowledge base.
- Implement BioBERT embeddings for semantic understanding.
- Construct a FAISS vector database for efficient retrieval.
- Orchestrate the RAG pipeline using LangChain.
- Generate context-aware responses using an LLM.
- Provide source references and medical disclaimers.
